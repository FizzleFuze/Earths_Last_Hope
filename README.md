## Earth's Last Hope

Commander,

You are Earth's last hope. You have been designated the leader of your group of Human refugees. You must lead the people in your rocket and build a functional colony on Mars.

Things are looking pretty bad down here. I'm not sure how much help we can provide, but we'll do our best. I'll be in touch soon with more details.
